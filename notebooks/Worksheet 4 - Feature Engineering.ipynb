    "Finally, let's tackle the **ngram** feature. There are multiple steps involved to derive this feature. Here in this notebook, we use an implementation outlined in the this academic paper [Schiavoni 2014: \"Phoenix: DGA-based Botnet Tracking and Intelligence\" - see section: Linguistic Features](http://s2lab.isg.rhul.ac.uk/papers/files/dimva2014.pdf).\n",

    "\n",
    "- **What are ngrams???** Imagine a string like 'facebook', if I were to derive all n-grams for n=2 (aka bi-grams) I would get '['fa', 'ac', 'ce', 'eb', 'bo', 'oo', 'ok']', so you see that you slide with one step from the left and just group 2 characters together each time, a tri-gram for 'facebook' would yielfd '['fac', 'ace', 'ceb', 'ebo', 'boo', 'ook']'. Ngrams have a long history in natural language processing, but are also used a lot for example in detecting malicious executable (raw byte ngrams in this case).\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps involved:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We have the 10000 most common english words (see data file we loaded, we call this DataFrame ```top_en_words``` in this notebook). Now we run the ```ngrams``` functions on a list of all these words. The output here is a list that contains ALL 1-grams, bi-grams and tri-grams of these 10000 most common english words.\n",
    "2. We use the ```Counter``` function from collections to derive a dictionary ```d``` that contains the counts of all unique 1-grams, bi-grams and tri-grams.\n",
    "3. Our ```ngram_feature``` function will do the core magic. It takes your domain as input, splits it into ngrams (n is a function parameter) and then looks up these ngrams in the english dictionary ```d``` we derived in step 2. Function returns the normalized sum of all ngrams that were contained in the english dictionary. For example, running ```ngram_feature('facebook', d, 2)``` will return 171.28 (this value is just like the one published in the Schiavoni paper).\n",
    "4. Finally ```average_ngram_feature``` wraps around ```ngram_feature```. You will use this function as your task is to derive a feature that gives the average of the ngram_feature for n=1,2 and 3. Input to this function should be a simple list with entries calling ```ngram_feature``` with n=1,2 and 3, hence a list of 3 ngram_feature results.   \n",
    "5. **YOUR TURN: Apply ```average_ngram_feature``` to you domain column in the DataFrame thereby adding ```ngram``` to the df.**\n",
    "6. **YOUR TURN: Finally drop the ```domain``` column from your DataFrame**.\n",
